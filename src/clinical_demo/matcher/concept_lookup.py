"""Surface-form → ConceptSet lookup with terminology-or-alias dispatch.

The extractor produces criterion payloads with surface text like
`"hba1c"`, `"type 2 diabetes"`, `"metformin"`. The matcher needs to
convert those into coded concept sets so it can query the
`PatientProfile`. Two paths exist; `Settings.binding_strategy`
selects between them:

- **`alias` (legacy):** the hand-curated `_*_ALIASES`
  tables in this module are the only source. Fully offline, no NLM
  dependency, fully auditable in a 30-second read.
- **`two_pass` (default):** consult reviewed terminology decisions,
  the trial-side bindings registry, and warmed resolver cache rows.
  Live VSAC / UMLS / RxNorm lookup is controlled separately by
  `Settings.resolver_execution_policy` and is disabled by default.
  Aliases stay as the offline legacy safety net during migration.

Either way, anything that survives both paths maps to
`unmapped_concept` and the matcher returns `indeterminate` -- the
*honest* signal that the system doesn't know, which is more useful
than a fuzzy match that pretends to know. The D-68 baseline
diagnostic surfaced `unmapped_concept` as the largest source of
indeterminacy (89% of all indeterminate verdicts on the 2026-04-21
baseline); D-69 slice 4 is the wire-up that lets the eval rerun
measure how much of that gap a small bindings registry actually
closes.
