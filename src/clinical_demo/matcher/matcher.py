"""Deterministic per-criterion matcher (v0).

Walks each `ExtractedCriterion` (from the LLM extractor), dispatches
on `kind`, queries the `PatientProfile` (built atop the patient's
typed FHIR record), and emits a `MatchVerdict` per criterion.

What "deterministic" means here
-------------------------------
- No LLM calls. No RAG. No embeddings. No fuzzy matching.
- Every concept the matcher recognizes is in `concept_lookup.py`;
  anything else returns `indeterminate (unmapped_concept)`.
- Every numeric comparison goes through `PatientProfile.meets_threshold`,
  which fails closed on unit mismatches and stale data.
- Polarity is applied at the end: the per-kind matcher computes the
  *raw* answer to "does the patient satisfy the predicate", then
  `_apply_polarity` flips for exclusion criteria and `negated=True`.

What v0 does NOT cover (deliberate)
-----------------------------------
- Compound criteria (AND/OR within one criterion) — the extractor
  splits these where it can; what remains lands as `free_text`.
- Hypothetical mood (planned events) — no patient-side data exists
  on planned events, so we return `indeterminate (unsupported_mood)`.
- Medications — the v0 concept lookup table is empty for meds (see
  D-34 in PLAN.md); they all return `unmapped_concept`.
- Soft thresholds, severity qualifiers, lateralities — out of scope.

The eval harness will measure where the matcher's "ok" verdicts
agree with hand labels and where its "indeterminate" verdicts cluster.
That is exactly the surface we want for v0: a baseline that's
*honest* about what it doesn't handle yet.
