"""On-disk cache for terminology bindings.

The terminology APIs (VSAC, RxNorm, UMLS) sit at the edge of the
matcher: the same trial-side surface form ("type 2 diabetes",
"metformin", ...) resolves to the same `ConceptSet` for every
patient x trial x criterion pair. Re-calling NLM endpoints on every
eval pair would be wasteful (network latency, rate-limit risk) and —
more importantly for a regression-style baseline — would couple
"what the matcher decided yesterday" to "what NLM was serving
yesterday." The cache pins a binding-resolution result to disk so
re-runs are deterministic and so `--no-llm`-style offline scoring
can extend to "no live terminology calls" too.

Cache key (mirrors the D-66 extractor cache discipline)
-------------------------------------------------------
Filename embeds two things the on-disk envelope is sensitive to:

1. The query identity (e.g. for VSAC: the value-set OID + optional
   single-system filter, since the same OID expanded with and
   without a filter yields different `ConceptSet`s).
2. The on-disk envelope schema fingerprint (`vsac_envelope_fingerprint`).

Any change to either signal produces a different filename, so an old
envelope is *invisible* to the new read path rather than silently
pumping a stale or shape-mismatched binding through the matcher. Old
envelopes orphan in the same dir; gitignored, no harm.

Why fingerprint the envelope and not the underlying data model? Same
reason as D-66 for the extractor: humans should not be on the hook
to remember to bump a constant when a typed field is added. The
hash is automatic; the alternative (silent stale data) is exactly
the failure mode this cache exists to make impossible.

The cache is namespaced per terminology source. v0 supports VSAC
only; RxNorm and UMLS will land alongside their respective clients
(D-69 follow-on slice). Splitting the namespaces at the filename
level (rather than one big union envelope) keeps each source
independently revvable and lets us add a new source without
invalidating prior caches.
