"""LangGraph state schema for the scoring graph.

Why TypedDict, not Pydantic
---------------------------
LangGraph uses the state schema two ways:
  (1) as the contract between nodes, and
  (2) as the type the *reducers* dispatch on (the `Annotated[T, fn]`
      pattern).

Reducers compose updates from concurrent branches into a single
state. They don't get along with Pydantic's validation: every reducer
call would re-validate the model, which is both slow and incorrect
(intermediate states violate invariants by design — verdicts
accumulate one criterion at a time, so the "all criteria scored"
invariant can't hold mid-fan-in). `TypedDict + Annotated[list,
operator.add]` is what the LangGraph docs themselves recommend, and
what every example in the wild uses.

Domain models that *are* Pydantic (Patient, Trial, MatchVerdict,
ExtractionResult, …) are stored *inside* the dict by reference —
Pydantic's invariants apply to them individually; the dict is just
the carrier.

Two-channel design
------------------
We split the state into two TypedDicts:

  - `ScoringStateInput` — what `score_pair_graph` receives from the
    caller. Required keys only.
  - `ScoringState` — the full working state the graph operates on.
    Optional keys carry intermediate results (extraction, verdicts)
    and the final summary/rollup. Reducers handle the verdict list.

The split keeps the public entry point's typing crisp without
forcing callers to construct the full intermediate state.

    """Reducer: merge `(index, verdict)` tuples with replace-by-index.

    Why not just `operator.add`?
    --------------------------
    The first matcher fan-out emits one tuple per criterion; concat
    is the right semantics there (no index appears twice). But the
    critic loop's revise node re-runs the matcher for *one*
    criterion to fix a finding, which means we want the new tuple
    for that index to *supersede* the old one, not sit beside it.
    Plain concat would leave both, and the rollup's `sorted()` call
    would arbitrarily pick whichever stable-sort happened to land
    last — fine on a deterministic sort within one process, but
    fragile (any change to the rollup's sort key would silently
    flip which verdict wins).

    Replace-by-index is also what an auditor would expect: the most
    recent verdict for a given criterion is the verdict.

    On a fresh run with no revisions, this collapses to the same
    behaviour as concat (each index appears once on the right
    side). The cost is O(n_left + n_right * n_left) for the
    set-membership check, which is negligible at our criterion
    counts (typically < 50 per trial).
