"""Routing for the scoring graph.

Routing functions, played at distinct seams:

1. `fan_out_criteria` — a conditional edge from `extract` that
   returns either a list of `Send` objects (one per criterion) or
   the rollup node name when there's nothing to fan out. This is
   the LangGraph idiom for dynamic per-item parallelism.

2. `route_by_kind` — a conditional edge function (criterion → node
   name) that picks deterministic vs. LLM matcher for one criterion.
   Pulled out as its own module-level function so we can unit-test
   the routing decision in isolation, and so the v0.2 fall-back
   ("if deterministic returns indeterminate(unmapped_concept), try
   LLM") plugs in here without touching the graph wiring.

3. `route_after_critic` — Phase 2.2 conditional edge from the
   critic node, deciding revise / loop / finalize based on the
   findings list, the iteration budget, and a no-progress check.

Routing rule v0
---------------
  - `kind == "free_text"`            → llm_match
  - everything else                  → deterministic_match

This is deliberately conservative: the deterministic matcher is
fast, free, and exhaustively tested; we only call the LLM when the
deterministic matcher *cannot* decide by construction.
