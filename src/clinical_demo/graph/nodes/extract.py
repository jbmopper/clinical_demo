"""Extraction node: trial eligibility text → ExtractedCriteria + PatientProfile.

Two responsibilities:
  1. Resolve the extraction. If the caller pre-supplied one (cache
     hit, replay, eval harness), use it; otherwise call the LLM
     extractor. This is the same `extraction is None ?
     extract_criteria : passthrough` rule the imperative
     `score_pair()` uses, lifted to a node.
  2. Build the `PatientProfile` snapshot once, here, so each
     fan-out match branch shares it instead of re-instantiating.

The node returns a partial state update; LangGraph merges it onto
the channel.

    the matcher-visible criterion set complete without rebuilding
