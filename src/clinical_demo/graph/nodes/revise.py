"""Revise node: turn one critic finding into one targeted matcher re-run.

The revise node is the *enforcer* of the critic's findings. The
critic identifies process problems; the revise node performs a
single, scoped re-run that may change one verdict. It NEVER
changes more than one criterion per call. The loop runs the rollup
again afterwards and the next critic pass sees the updated state.

v0 dispatch table
-----------------
    finding kind                          → action
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    low_confidence_indeterminate          → rerun_match_with_focus
    extraction_disagreement_with_text     → rerun_match_with_focus
    polarity_smell                        → flip_polarity_and_rematch

The first two map to the same v0 action. They're separate finding
kinds because (a) they describe genuinely different process
problems and the eval pivot is more useful with the distinction,
and (b) v1 will split them (extraction_disagreement → re-extract
on source_text, low_confidence → re-match with richer context).

What "focus" means in v0
------------------------
The matcher gets the finding's rationale prepended to the user
message under a "REVIEWER NOTE" header. The matcher prompt was not
trained on this header, so it's read as additional context; the
behaviour change is small but observable in the matcher's
rationale. We don't claim more than this; the eval harness will
quantify whether focus actually moves verdicts.

What if the finding targets a deterministic verdict?
----------------------------------------------------
For `rerun_match_with_focus`, we *only* re-run via the LLM matcher
when the criterion is `free_text`. Re-running the deterministic
matcher on a coded criterion would produce the same answer
(it's deterministic, by construction). So we record a no-op
revision and move on; the eval can pivot on this case.

For `flip_polarity_and_rematch`, we mutate the criterion in-place
(polarity XOR) and dispatch by kind: deterministic for coded
criteria, LLM for free-text. The revision row records both the
flip and the new verdict.
