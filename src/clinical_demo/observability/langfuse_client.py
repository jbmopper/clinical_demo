"""Thin wrapper around the Langfuse v4 SDK.

Two design properties drive everything in this module:

1. **No-op when unconfigured.** A fresh checkout, a CI runner, or a
   local dev session without Langfuse keys must run end-to-end
   without crashing. The shim returns a sentinel client that
   accepts the same observation-context API but discards everything.
   No code path that emits a trace should have to know whether
   tracing is on.

2. **Defensive on every call.** Observability is *never* allowed to
   break the application path it instruments. Every Langfuse call
   the shim makes is wrapped in try/except; on failure we log a
   warning and continue. A lost trace is acceptable; a lost
   eligibility verdict because the analytics provider is down is
   not.

The actual Langfuse SDK class is imported lazily inside helpers so
that test code that monkey-patches `langfuse.Langfuse` works, and
so that import-time of the application doesn't pay the SDK setup
cost (which spins up an OpenTelemetry exporter thread) when tracing
is off.

Usage
-----
    from clinical_demo.observability import traced

    with traced("extract_criteria", as_type="generation",
                model="gpt-4o-mini", input=eligibility_text) as span:
        result = client.chat.completions.parse(...)
        span.update(output=result, usage_details={
            "input": result.usage.prompt_tokens,
            "output": result.usage.completion_tokens,
        })

If Langfuse keys are absent, `traced(...)` returns a no-op span whose
`.update()` / `.set_status()` / etc. methods exist but do nothing.
