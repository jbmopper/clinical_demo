"""Patient-side domain model.

These types are the canonical internal representation that all downstream
components (matchers, evaluators, UI) consume. They are deliberately simpler
than FHIR: only the fields we actually use, named for clinical clarity, and
with helpers that make as-of-date queries cheap.

Eligibility decisions are always evaluated *as of* a point in time. Every
query helper accepts an `as_of` parameter so the system can replay screenings
against historical states (e.g., for evals on retrospective trial cohorts).
