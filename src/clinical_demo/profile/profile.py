"""Patient Profiler v0.

A `PatientProfile` is a thin, as-of-date-anchored view over a `Patient`
that gives the matcher (and the seed-set labeler) the small set of
semantic primitives it actually uses, instead of forcing every caller
to re-implement the FHIR-y plumbing themselves.

Why a wrapper rather than a materialized snapshot? The Patient model is
already immutable Pydantic and queries against it are cheap; a
materialized snapshot would just add a copy-step and a "which view do
I trust" question. The wrapper approach also keeps the profile
trivially in sync if the underlying Patient is updated for whatever
reason (new lab arrives, etc.).

The primitives intentionally fall into three buckets, each a tri-state:
- conditions   → bool (present / absent)
- medications  → bool (active / inactive)
- thresholds   → `ThresholdResult` (meets / does_not_meet / no_data /
                                    stale_data / unit_mismatch)

Tri-state on thresholds matters: silently treating a missing lab as
"fail" would make the matcher hallucinate a confident verdict. Real
matcher output should distinguish "we know this fails" from "we don't
have the data to decide" — the latter is `indeterminate` from the
eval's perspective and triggers human review.

Unit aliases are handled per-LOINC. Real Synthea data uses `mL/min`
and `mL/min/{1.73_m2}` interchangeably for eGFR; we normalize these
inside `latest_lab`, but threshold checks fail-closed on units we
don't know about (so the matcher doesn't accidentally compare 7.0%
HbA1c to a 53 mmol/mol HbA1c without explicit conversion).
