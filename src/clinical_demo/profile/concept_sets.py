"""Curated concept sets for the matcher and the eval seed labeler.

**Status: legacy curated code lists.** D-69 adds the first NLM API
client for VSAC value-set expansion, but these constants remain the
matcher-wired source of truth until a terminology resolver is wired
through `concept_lookup.py` and the eval harness.

A `ConceptSet` is a *named* group of coded concepts (SNOMED conditions,
LOINC labs, RxNorm meds). The matcher uses these to answer questions
like "does the patient have any T2DM-coded condition" without
hard-coding code lists everywhere.

Keep this file small and curated. We expand it deliberately when a
new criterion type appears in our seed-set or in a real trial we care
about — not preemptively. The point is auditability: a reviewer can
read this file in a minute and see exactly which codes the matcher
treats as evidence of which clinical concept.
