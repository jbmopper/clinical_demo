"""Pydantic schema for the extracted-criteria structured output.

This is the contract between the LLM extractor and the deterministic
matcher. Two design rules drove the shape:

1. **Matcher-ready, not Chia-shaped.** Chia's annotation graph
   (entities + binary relations + n-ary equivalence groups + scopes)
   is a research-grade representation for *humans*. Our matcher, by
   contrast, just needs to know "what kind of criterion is this and
   which slots does it bind?" So each criterion gets a discriminated
   `kind` and a small typed payload, rather than a soup of entities
   and relations the matcher would have to re-resolve. The Chia entity
   vocabulary is preserved as a flat `mentions` list per criterion for
   citation and audit, but it is *not* the load-bearing structure.

2. **OpenAI strict-mode-friendly.** OpenAI's structured-outputs strict
   mode rejects schemas that use `additionalProperties`, default
   values, optional fields without explicit `null`, or open-ended
   `dict` types. Every field in the schemas below is therefore
   required; nullability is expressed via `T | None`; enums use
   `Literal`; lists are typed concretely. Discriminated unions are
   not natively supported under strict mode either, so each criterion
   row carries a `kind` discriminator string plus parallel optional
   payloads (only one of which is non-null per row). The matcher
   dispatches on `kind` at runtime.
