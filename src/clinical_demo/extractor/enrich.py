"""Post-extraction enrichment from CT.gov structured fields.

The criterion extractor reads only `Trial.eligibility_text`, but
trials publish age/sex bounds in CT.gov structured fields
(`minimumAge`, `maximumAge`, `sex`) that the eligibility prose
sometimes restates and sometimes does not. When those bounds live
*only* in the structured fields, the extractor produces no `age` /
`sex` criterion -- and the layer-1 eval reports the cell as
`missing` even though the matcher could have scored it trivially
against the patient profile.

This module fills that gap *deterministically*, after extraction,
**without** touching the prompt:

- Scan the extracted criteria. If one of `kind="age"` / `kind="sex"`
  is already present, leave it alone (the LLM is closer to the
  eligibility text and may have nuanced the bounds, e.g. "18-65
  except <70 with ECOG=0"; we don't override).
- Otherwise, parse the corresponding structured field and inject
  a synthetic `ExtractedCriterion` with a sentinel `source_text`
  (`"[ct.gov structured field: ...]"`) so reviewers and the
  citation UI can tell the difference between LLM-extracted and
  CT.gov-injected criteria at a glance.

Why a post-processor and not a prompt change:

1. Determinism. The trial designer asserts "minimum age = 18" as
   structured data; an LLM re-interpreting that string is silly
   and lossy. Post-process keeps it canonical.
2. Cache reuse. Bumping `PROMPT_VERSION` invalidates the D-66
   extractor cache (30 cached extractions per current curated
   set). The Rule-13 patch just did this; doing it again for a
   purely deterministic mechanic would be wasteful.
3. Layered concerns. The extractor does free-text -> structured;
   this layer enforces invariants from a different (canonical)
   source. Wiring them through one prompt would conflate them.
4. Provenance. Anyone reading the enriched extraction can tell
   which criteria came from the LLM vs. from the CT.gov
   structured fields by inspecting `source_text` -- impossible
   if the LLM had absorbed the structured fields into its
   typical-looking output.

Sex="ALL" is a no-op: it does not constrain the matcher and an
injected `kind="sex"` row with `sex="ALL"` would just clutter the
verdict list. Sex="MALE"/"FEMALE" inject normally.
