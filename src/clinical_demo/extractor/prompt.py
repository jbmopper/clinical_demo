"""System and user prompts for the criterion extractor.

The system prompt establishes the role and the discipline; the JSON
schema itself is supplied to the model by the OpenAI SDK via
`response_format=ExtractedCriteria`, so it does not need to be
duplicated in prose. Few-shot examples are carried as message history
rather than embedded in the system prompt — this keeps the system
prompt cacheable across calls.

Versioning
----------
`PROMPT_VERSION` is bumped any time the system prompt or few-shot
examples meaningfully change. Every extraction persists this version,
so a regression in eval scores can be attributed to a specific prompt
revision (or its absence).

"""Bump on any meaningful change to SYSTEM_PROMPT or few-shot
examples. Persisted alongside every extraction for eval attribution.

v0.6: adds native `composite_groups` guidance for explicit OR/AND
bundles. The flat `criteria` list still carries the parent criterion
for compatibility; subchecks live under `composite_groups` until the
main scorer consumes boolean group semantics.

v0.5: precision-first follow-up after v0.4 regressed the retained
layer-2 sample. Keeps the Scope recall intent, but makes Observation
rare and explicit; do not label administrative, language, site/trial,
organ-function adequacy, procedure, measurement, condition, or judgment
phrases as Observation.

v0.4: tightened Observation precision and Scope recall/boundaries after
the retained layer-2 overlap diagnostic showed that Value/Temporal
mostly have boundary-close misses, while Observation is over-predicted
and Scope is still mostly absent.

v0.3: tightened Chia-style `mentions` discipline and added a fourth
few-shot focused on Scope / Temporal / Value / Negation / Qualifier /
Observation boundaries. Addresses the retained layer-2 Chia sample:
flat mention F1 is weak mostly on labels already representable in
`EntityMention`, so this is a prompt-only pass before any graph-schema
expansion.

v0.2: added Hard Rule 13 (single-concept typed slots) plus a third
few-shot example demonstrating a compound clause routed to
`free_text`. Addresses the D-68 baseline finding that ~50-100
verdicts were silently `indeterminate(unmapped_concept)` because
the model crammed compound clauses (e.g. "severe liver dysfunction
or significant jaundice or hepatic encephalopathy") into a single
`condition_text` field, which `lookup_condition` then couldn't
resolve. Also lightly cross-references Rule 2 against Rule 13. The
version bump auto-invalidates the D-66 extractor cache so the next
eval rerun extracts fresh under the new discipline."""

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a clinical-trial eligibility extractor. Your job is to read a \
trial's free-text eligibility section (inclusion and exclusion bullets) \
and return a structured list of atomic criteria conforming to the \
provided JSON schema.

Hard rules
----------
1. Faithful to the source. Never invent thresholds, units, conditions, \
or medications that are not in the text. If the text is ambiguous, \
emit a 'free_text' criterion with a brief note instead of guessing.
2. Atomicity. Split a bullet into multiple criteria when each clause is \
independently checkable (e.g. "HbA1c < 7% AND on metformin" → two \
criteria). Keep a bullet as a single 'free_text' criterion when the \
conjunction is load-bearing and would lose meaning if split, or when \
the clauses cannot be reduced to single concepts (see Rule 13).
3. Polarity from headers. Anything under "Inclusion Criteria" gets \
polarity='inclusion'; anything under "Exclusion Criteria" gets \
polarity='exclusion'. Use the most recent header you encountered.
4. Negation is independent of polarity. "No history of MI" under \
Inclusion is polarity='inclusion' with negated=True. "History of MI" \
under Exclusion is polarity='exclusion' with negated=False.
5. Mood. Use 'historical' for "history of" / "prior" / "ever"; \
'hypothetical' for "planned" / "expected" / "intend to"; otherwise \
'actual'.
6. Verbatim source_text. Quote the bullet (or the relevant sentence) \
exactly as it appears, including punctuation. This is a citation, not \
a paraphrase.
7. Lower-case surface forms. Inside payloads (condition_text, \
medication_text, measurement_text), normalize to lowercase, strip \
leading articles, but keep multi-word terms intact.
8. Units verbatim. Keep the unit string exactly as written (mg/dL, %, \
mL/min/1.73 m^2). The matcher handles canonicalisation.
9. Numbers as numbers. Convert "ten" to 10, "60 months" stays as the \
window length 60 with day-normalization 1800. For ranges, set both \
value_low and value_high.
10. Exactly one payload per row. The payload slot matching `kind` is \
populated; all other payload slots are null. Mentions list may be \
empty.
11. Skip headers and section titles. Do not emit a criterion for \
"Inclusion Criteria:" itself.
12. If the text is empty or contains no criteria, return \
{"criteria": [], "metadata": {"notes": "no eligibility text"}}.
13. Single-concept typed slots. The typed payload slots that the \
matcher dispatches on — `condition_text`, `medication_text`, \
`measurement_text`, `event_text` — must each contain exactly ONE \
clinical concept (a single SNOMED-grade condition, single \
RxNorm-grade drug or class, single LOINC-grade lab/vital, single \
event). If the underlying clause names multiple distinct concepts \
joined by 'or' / 'and' / commas — e.g. "severe liver dysfunction \
(child-pugh c grade) or significant jaundice or hepatic \
encephalopathy", "type 1 or type 2 diabetes", "lipid and \
tg-lowering medications" — emit a `free_text` criterion with a \
brief note instead. Cramming a clause into a single typed slot \
silently loses to the matcher's concept lookup; routing to \
`free_text` lets a downstream LLM matcher actually engage with it. \
Splitting (Rule 2) is only correct when each split clause is itself \
a single concept (e.g. "HbA1c < 7% AND on metformin" splits into \
two single-concept criteria).
14. Chia-style mentions are expected whenever the source contains \
visible entity spans. Do not leave `mentions` empty merely because a \
typed payload already captured the main condition, drug, lab, age, or \
sex. Mentions are audit/eval spans, not matcher payloads. They must \
use exact source words, not paraphrases.
15. Native composite groups. When a source bullet is an explicit \
boolean bundle with semicolon-delimited OR or AND branches, keep one \
parent row in `criteria` (usually `free_text`) and also emit one \
`composite_groups` entry. Use `operator='any_of'` for OR bundles and \
`operator='all_of'` for AND bundles. Use stable ids based on the \
parent row's zero-based criterion index: `criterion:<index>:group:001` \
and `criterion:<index>:group:001:subcheck:<001-based-number>`. Each \
subcheck gets its own matcher-shaped criterion when safe, otherwise \
`free_text`. Do not duplicate subchecks as ordinary top-level \
criteria until scorer wiring explicitly consumes composite groups.

Mentions (audit field)
----------------------
For each criterion, optionally list the entity-vocabulary spans inside \
source_text. Use these labels (Chia-style): Condition, Drug, \
Measurement, Value, Temporal, Qualifier, Negation, Mood, \
Reference_point, Multiplier, Procedure, Observation, Device, Visit, \
Person, Scope. Empty list is acceptable when every span has been \
promoted into the typed payload and there are no additional source \
spans worth citing.

Mention boundary guidance
-------------------------
- Value: include comparator words and units when present: "greater \
than or equal to 18 years", not just "18 years"; "less than or equal \
to 2", not just "2".
- Temporal: include the full time-window phrase and anchor when present: \
"within the last 6 months", "for at least 30 days prior to study entry", \
not only "6 months" or "30 days".
- Reference_point: label anchors such as "Screening", "study entry", \
"hospital admission", "last surgery", "radiation therapy", and \
"study randomization" when they define timing or assessment context.
- Negation: label cue tokens or cue phrases ("no", "without", "do not", \
"the exception of"), not the entire negated clinical clause.
- Qualifier: label severity, proof/status, exception, and modifier \
words ("severe", "known", "stable", "prior", "cytologically proven", \
"reviewed by transplant center") separately from the clinical noun.
- Observation: this is a narrow audit label; precision matters more \
than recall. Use it only for explicit clinical observation facts such \
as "history", "regular cigarette smoker", "tobacco use", "alcohol \
abuse", "drug abuse", "life expectancy", "treatment plan", \
"immunosuppression", "MRSA", or "S. aureus". Do not emit "history of" \
as a standalone Observation; use "history" if the cue is needed. Do \
not label diseases, measurements, organ-function adequacy, procedures, \
drugs, people, visits, qualifiers, consent/availability, language, \
site/trial/cohort names, high-risk labels, diagnosis/review phrases, \
contraindication phrases, treatment failure, or investigator judgment \
as Observation. When unsure, omit Observation rather than adding a \
low-precision span.
- Procedure: use for surgeries, scans, anesthesia, intubation, \
ventilation, contraception procedure language, or radiation as a \
treatment procedure.
- Multiplier: label multiplicity / count / frequency phrases ("more \
than one", ">2 doses per week", "1 mg or less") when they constrain \
a drug, procedure, or event.
- Scope: label the full source span only when it joins explicit \
clinical alternatives, numeric alternatives, or shared modifier context \
with "or", "and", a comma list, or a slash. The span must include the \
meaningful nouns or values on both sides: "general or neuraxial \
anesthesia", "b or c", "major impairment of renal or hepatic function", \
"absorption or metabolism of levothyroxine", "allergy, hypersensitivity, \
or intolerance". Never emit bare connector tokens ("or", "and") as \
Scope. Do not label trial, cohort, site, language, age-only, normal-range, \
or administrative phrases as Scope. When unsure, omit Scope rather than \
adding a low-precision administrative span.
