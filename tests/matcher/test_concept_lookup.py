"""Concept-lookup tests.

The lookup tables drive the matcher's recall: a missed alias means a
verdict drops to `indeterminate (unmapped_concept)` even when the
patient data would otherwise resolve it. These tests pin the major
condition / lab aliases we rely on; the medication table is
deliberately empty in v0 (see concept_lookup.py docstring)."""
